Description: A set of tools for basic tensor operators.  A tensor in the context of data analysis in a multidimensional array. The tools in this package rely on using any discrete transformation (e.g. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)).  Standard tools included are the Eigenvalue decomposition of a tensor, the QR decomposition and LU decomposition.  Other functionality includes the inverse of a tensor and the transpose of a symmetric tensor. Functionality in the package is outlined in Kernfeld et al. (2015) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379515004358>.
